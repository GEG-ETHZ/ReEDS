# ReEDS

The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model is a capacity expansion model of the continental United States power system that can simulate generation and transmission investment and operating decisions from 2010 to 2050: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/

ReEDS is developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO, USA. NREL provides an open source version of the ReEDS: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/request-access-form.html

The data and code files posted in this repository are related to projects completed in the GEG group at ETH Zurich that build off NREL's open source ReEDS model.
