# ReEDS

The Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model is a capacity expansion model of the continental United States power system that can simulate generation and transmission investment and operating decisions from 2010 to 2050: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/

ReEDS is developed and maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). An an open source version of ReEDS can be downloaded: https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/reeds/request-access-form.html

The data and code files posted in this repository are related to projects completed in the GEG group at ETH Zurich that build off and use NREL's open source ReEDS code. At this time, only one project has been completed: reeds_and_sco2t. The code and data in that folder is supplemental information for a manuscript that is currently in review.
